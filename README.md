# Pynteractive: Interactive plots in python
Pynterative is a python library aimed to create interative visualizations provided by several HTML5 JavaScript libraries like vis.js or d3.js.

It was motivated by the need of using HTML5 plots in biomedical research, (bioinformatics to be specific), however different charts and plots are being introduced as they are requested/needed. 

It is designed to implement a very simple API allowing bidirectional communications. (Python <--> webbrowser)

## Current features:

* Graphs: graphs and digraphs provided by the vis.js framework
* Trees
* Maps: provided by leaflet (openstreet maps)

## Compatibility:

It requires an HTML5 browser and currently it has been tested in Google Chome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox.
